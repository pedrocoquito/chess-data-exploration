# Chess Data Exploration

## Objectives

This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis and preprocessing on chess match data. Using the provided dataset, the goal is to analyse:

- Win distribution based on the colors (white vs. black).
- Which chess openings result in more victories for each color.
- The influence of player rating on the likelihood of winning or drawing.
- Draw tendencies for specific openings.
- Identification of potential outliers in player ratings and their impact on the analysis.

The analyses focus on understanding the relationship between chess openings, player ratings, and match outcomes.
